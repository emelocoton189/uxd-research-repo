User Experience Design Research Repository

Welcome to my UXD Research repository. This is a living archive of my growth as a UX professional focusing on research, systems thinking, facilitation, and collaboration.  
**Note**: This is *not* a coding portfolio.

## ðŸŒ± Purpose

This space is where I:
- Document case studies and project retrospectives
- Share templates and resources I've created or adapted
- Reflect on books, courses, and ongoing learning

## ðŸ§  UX Philosophy

I believe great UX emerges from a deep understanding of people, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and continuous iteration. I aim to contribute strategic insight and clarity to complex systems, especially in mission-driven spaces.
