When I joined the workstream, UX deliverables for a critical support request kept getting rejected and stakeholders were frustrated by missed requirements. I recognized that the **scope had outgrown the original support request**, so I escalated it to the UX Team Lead, proposing a reframe based on information architecture gaps and unmet user needs.

I led **usability testing to investigate pain points** and discovered that users couldn’t edit submitted forms or easily add multiple entries, causing excessive rework and frustration. Instead of proceeding with the planned basic web form, I **recommended and supported the design of a stand-alone application** with streamlined features to match real user workflows.

After launch, a user described the new interface as “much cleaner” than legacy portals. Within the first year, the app supported over **15,000 successful submissions**, dramatically improving usability and stakeholder satisfaction.
