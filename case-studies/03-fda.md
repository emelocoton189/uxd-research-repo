**Project:** Information Architecture of Customer Collaboration Portal 
**Client:** FDA, Centers for Devices and Radiological Health 
**Role:** UX Design Lead

When I joined the workstream, the product team was struggling to justify competing screen designs. Screens were built based on **stakeholder assumptions**, not verified user needs, and neither side could clearly articulate why their design was best.

I conducted **12 user interviews** and identified that a critical column, essential to efficiently processing submissions, was **missing from the Manager View**. This missing data led to delays and unnecessary back-and-forth communication between manufacturers and the FDA.

Teams previously assumed the “Coordinator View” was needed, but I discovered its only real value was that it included this missing data. I recommended **removing the redundant Coordinator View** and adding the key column to the Manager View. This change streamlined workflows and enabled device manufacturers to **respond to FDA feedback more quickly and effectively**.
