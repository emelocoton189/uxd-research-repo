**Project:** Website Redesign for Texas Legislative Council <br>
**Client:** Texas Legislative Council, Research Division <br>
**Role:** Solo UX Designer & Project Manager

I spearheaded the redesign of **4 external agency applications** over several years, operating as the **sole UX professional** on the team. Before the redesign, user engagement was low and stakeholder feedback indicated difficulty finding key resources.

To understand user needs, I conducted **user interviews and usability tests**, uncovering that our navigation structure and content hierarchy were confusing and not aligning with how real users worked. I simplified screens and reorganized content by priority, leading to cleaner, more intuitive navigation.

As a result, we saw a **54% increase in time spent on key pages** and achieved a **90% customer satisfaction rating** post-launch. Following the redesign, the council reported improved access for external users seeking legislative guidance and updates.
