**Project:** Website Redesign for NIH Executive Support Team 
**Client:** NIH, Office of the Executive Secretariat 
**Role:** UX Design Lead

I led a **6-week website redesign** effort for the NIH Executive Support Team, managing a **team of 3** and balancing tight timelines with high visibility requirements. The original site was disorganized and content-heavy, which made it difficult for internal stakeholders to find critical information during the COVID-19 response.

I facilitated collaborative working sessions, translated vague requirements into structured page hierarchies, and created annotated wireframes to ensure alignment with both NIH branding and accessibility standards.

NIH stakeholders praised the final product, saying the **quality of work and communication exceeded expectations**. Our team’s efficiency and clarity helped optimize development time and ensured smooth deployment of public health resources during a high-pressure period.
